          O-Sei San, Gertrude Beckette, Nelly Boustead, Suzanne Jacoby and Josephine Bracken. These women might have been beguiled

                  filibustero. She hid from Leonor all letters sent to her sweetheart. Leonor believing that Rizal had already forgotten her,
                  sadly consented her to marry the Englishman Henry Kipping, her mother’s choice.

                  fell in love with her and Consuelo apparently asked him for romantic verses. He suddenly backed out before the relationship
                  turned into a serious romance, because he wanted to remain loyal to Leonor Rivera and he did not want to destroy his friendship
                  with Eduardo de Lete who was madly in love with Consuelo.

                  While Rizal was in London annotating the Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, he boarded in the house of the Beckett family,
                  within walking distance of the British Museum. Gertrude, a blue-eyed and buxom girl was the oldest of the three Beckett daughters.
                  She fell in love with Rizal. Tottie helped him in his painting and sculpture. But Rizal suddenly left London for Paris
                  to avoid Gertrude, who was seriously in love with him. Before leaving London, he was able to finish the group carving of the
                  Beckett sisters. He gave the group carving to Gertrude as a sign of their brief relationship.

                  Rizal having lost Leonor Rivera, entertained the thought of courting other ladies. While a guest of the Boustead family at
                  their residence in the resort city of Biarritz, he had befriended the two pretty daughters of his host, Eduardo Boustead.
                  Rizal used to fence with the sisters at the studio of Juan Luna. Antonio Luna, Juan’s brother and also a frequent visitor of the
                  Bousteads, courted Nellie but she was deeply infatuated with Rizal. In a party held by Filipinos in Madrid, a drunken Antonio Luna
                  uttered unsavory remarks against Nellie Boustead. This prompted Rizal to challenge Luna into a duel. Fortunately, Luna apologized
                  to Rizal, thus averting tragedy for the compatriots.
                  <br><br>
                  Their love affair unfortunately did not end in marriage. It failed because Rizal refused to be converted to the Protestant faith,
                  as Nellie demanded and Nellie’s mother did not like a physician without enough paying clientele to be a son-in-law. The lovers,
                  however, parted as good friends when Rizal left Europe.

                  In 1890, Rizal moved to Brussels because of the high cost of living in Paris. In Brussels, he lived in the boarding house
                  of the two Jacoby sisters. In time, they fell deeply in love with each other. Suzanne cried when Rizal left Brussels and wrote
                  him when he was in Madrid.

                  In the last days of February 1895, while still in Dapitan, Rizal met an 18-year old petite Irish girl, with bold blue eyes,
                  brown hair and a happy disposition. She was Josephine Bracken, the adopted daughter of George Taufer from Hong Kong,
                  who came to Dapitan to seek Rizal for eye treatment. Rizal was physically attracted to her. His loneliness and boredom must
                  have taken the measure of him and what could be a better diversion that to fall in love again. But the Rizal sisters suspected
                  Josephine as an agent of the friars and they considered her as a threat to Rizal’s security.
