            <h6>Huling Paalam (Mi Ultimo Adios)</h6>
            <p>
              Paalam na, sintang lupang tinubuan,
              <br>
              Bayang masagana sa init ng araw,
              <br>
              Edeng maligaya sa ami’y pumanaw
              <br>
              At perlas ng dagat sa dakong Silangan.
              <br>
              <br>

              Inihahandog ko ng ganap na tuwa
              <br>
              Sa iyo yaring buhay na lanta na’t aba;
              <br>
              Naging dakila ma’y iaalay rin nga
              <br>
              Kung dahil sa iyong ikatitimawa.
              <br>
              <br>

              Ang nanga sa digmaan dumog sa paglaban
              <br>
              Handog din sa iyo ang kanilang buhay,
              <br>
              Hirap ay di pansin at di gunamgunam
              <br>
              Ang pagkaparool o pagtagumpay.
              <br>
              <br>


              Bibitaya’t madlang mabangis na sakit
              <br>
              O pakikibakang lubhang mapanganib,
              <br>
              Pawang titiisin kung ito ang nais
              <br>
              Ng baya’t tahanang pinakaiibig.
              <br>
                      <br><br>

              Ako’y mamamatay ngayong minamalas
              <br>
              Ang kulay ng langit na nanganganinag
              <br>
              Ibinababalang araw ay sisikat
              <br>
              Sa kabila niyang mapanglaw na ulap.
              <br>
              <br>

              Kung dugo ang iyong kinakailangan
              <br>
              Sa ikadidilag ng iyong pagsilang,
              <br>
              Dugo ko’y ibubo’t sa isa man lamang
              <br>
              Nang gumigiti mong sinag ay kuminang.
              <br>


              Ang mga nasa ko, mulang magkaisip,
              <br>
              Magpahanggang ngayon maganap ang bait,
              <br>
              Ang ikaw’y makitnag hiyas na marikit
              <br>
              Ng dagat Silangan na nakaliligid.
              <br>
              <br>        <br>

              Noo mo’y maningning at sa mga mata
              <br>
              Mapait na luha bakas ma’y wala na,
              <br>
              Wala ka ng poot, wala ng balisa,
              <br>
              Walang kadungua’t munti mang pangamba,
              <br>
              <br>

              Sa sandaling buhay maalab kong nais
              <br>
              Ang kagalingan mo’t ang paiwang sulit
              <br>
              Ng kaluluwa king gayak ng aalis:
              <br>
              Ginhawa’y kamtan mo! Anong pagkarikit!
              <br>
              <br>


              Nang maaba’t ikaw’y mapataas lamang,
              <br>
              Mamatay at upang mabigyan kang buihay,
              <br>
              Malibing sa lupang puspos ng karika’t
              <br>
              Sa silong ng iyong langit ay mahimlay.
              <br>
              <br>


              Kung sa ibang araw ikaw’y may mapansin
              <br>
              Nipot na bulaklak sa aba kong libing,
              <br>
              Sa gitna ng mga damong masisinsin,
              <br>
              Hagka’t ang halik mo’y itaos sa akin.
              <br>
              <br>

              Sa samyo ng iyong pagsuyong matamis,
              <br>
              Mataos na taghoy ng may sintang sibsib,
              <br>
              Bayang tumaggap noo ko ng init,
              <br>
              Na natatabunan ng lupang malamig.
              <br>
              <br>


              Bayan mong ako’y malasin ng buwan
              <br>
              Sa liwang niyang hilano’t malamlam;
              <br>
              Bayan ihatid sa aking liwayway
              <br>
              Ang banaang niyang dagling napaparam.
              <br>
              <br>


              Bayaang humalik ang simoy ng hangin;
              <br>
              Bayaang sa huning masaya’y awitin
              <br>
              Ng darapong ibon sa kurus ng libing
              <br>
              Ang buhay payapang ikinaaaliw.
              <br>
              <br>


              Bayaang ang araw na lubhang maningas
              <br>
              Pawiin ang ulan, gawing pawang ulap,
              <br>
              Maging panganuring sa langit umakyat,
              <br>
              At ang aking daing ay mapakilangkap.
              <br>
              <br>


              Bayaang ang aking maagang pagpanw,
              <br>
              Itangis ng isnag lubos na nagmamahal;
              <br>
              Kung may umalala sa akin ng dasal,
              <br>
              Ako’y iyo sanang idalangin naman.
              <br>
              <br>

              Idalangin mo rin ang di nagkapalad,
              <br>
              Na nangamatay na’t yaong nanganhirap
              <br>
              sa daming pasakit, at ang lumalangap
              <br>
              naming mga ina luhang masaklap.
              <br>
              <br>


              Idalangin sampo ng bawa’t ulila
              <br>
              at nangapipiit na tigib ng dusa;
              <br>
              idalangin mo ring ikaw’y matubos na
              <br>
              sa pagkaaping laong binata.
              <br>
              <br>


              Kung nababalot na ang mga libingan
              <br>
              Ng sapot na itim ng gabing mapanglaw,
              <br>
              at wala ng tanod kundi pawing patay,
              <br>
              huwang gambalain ang katahimikan.
              <br>
              <br>


              Pagpitagan mo ang hiwagang lihim,
              <br>
              at mapapakinggan ang tinig marahil,
              <br>
              ng isang saltero: Ito nga’y ako ring
              <br>
              inaawitanka ng aking paggiliw.
              <br>
              <br>


              Kung ang libingan kong limot na ang madla
              <br>
              ay wala nang kurus at bato mang tanda
              <br>
              sa nangangabubukid ay ipaubayang
              <br>
              bungkali’t isabog ang natipong lupa.
              <br>
              <br>


              Ang mga abo ko’y bago pailanglang
              <br>
              mauwi sa wala na pinaggalingan,
              <br>
              ay makalt munag parang kapupunanng
              <br>
              iyong alabok sa lupang tuntungan.
              <br>
              <br>


              Sa gayo’y walaa ng anoman sa akin,
              <br>
              na limutin mo ma’t aking lilibutin
              <br>

              <br>
              at ako sa iyo’y magiging taginting.
              <br>
              <br>


              Bango, tinig, higing, awit na masaya

              at ang naghahari Diyos na dakila.
              <br>

              Paalam anak, magulang, kapatid,
              <br>
              bahagi ng puso’t unang nakaniig,

              To my Creator I sing
              <br>
              Who did soothe me in my great loss;
              <br>
              To the Merciful and Kind
              <br>
              Who in my troubles gave me repose.
              <br>
              <br>

              Thou with that pow'r of thine
              <br>
              Said: Live! And with life myself I found;
              <br>
              And shelter gave me thou
              <br>
              And a soul impelled to the good
              <br>
              Like a compass whose point to the North is bound.
              <br>
              <br>

              Thou did make me descend

              From honorable home and respectable stock,
              <br>
              And a homeland thou gavest me

              Without limit, fair and rich
              <br>
              Though fortune and prudence it does lack.

              Even death is gratifying and more tender is love.
              <br>

              On her lap, upon the infant child's awakening,
              <br>
              The extended arms do seek her neck to entwine,
              <br>
              And the eyes at each other's glimpse are smiling.
              <br>
              <br>

              It is sweet to die in one's own Native Land,
              <br>
              All there is friendly o'er which the sun shines above;
              <br>
              And deathly is the breeze for one without
              <br>
              A country, without a mother and without love.

              Full of grace and pure like the Morn that peeps
              <br>
              When in the sky the clouds are tinted blue,
              <br>
              Of th' Indian land, a goddess sleeps.
              <br>
              <br>

              The light foam of the son'rous sea
              <br>
              Doth kiss her feet with loving desire;
              <br>
              The cultured West adores her smile
              <br>
              And the frosty Pole her flow'red attire.
              <br>
              <br>

              With tenderness, stammering, my Muse
              <br>
              To her 'midst undines and naiads does sing;
              <br>
              I offer her my fortune and bliss:
              <br>
              Oh, artists! her brow chaste ring

              With myrtle green and roses red

              And lilies, and extol the Philippines!

              When I recall the days
              <br>
              That saw my childhood of yore
              <br>
              Beside the verdant shore
              <br>
              Of a murmuring lagoon;
              <br>
              When I remember the sighs
              <br>
              Of the breeze that on my brow
              <br>
              Sweet and caressing did blow
              <br>
              With coolness full of delight;
              <br>
              <br>

              When I look at the lily white
              <br>
              Fills up with air violent
              <br>
              And the stormy element
              <br>
              On the sand doth meekly sleep;
              <br>
              When sweet 'toxicating scent
              <br>
              From the flowers I inhale
              <br>
              Which at the dawn they exhale
              <br>
              When at us it begins to peep;
              <br>
              <br>

              I sadly recall your face,
              <br>
              Oh precious infancy,
              <br>
              That a mother lovingly
              <br>
              Did succeed to embellish.
              <br>
              I remember a simple town;
              <br>
              My cradle, joy and boon,
              <br>
              Beside the cool lagoon
              <br>
              The seat of all my wish.
              <br>
              <br>

              Oh, yes! With uncertain pace
              <br>
              I trod your forest lands,
              <br>
              And on your river banks
              <br>
              A pleasant fun I found;
              <br>
              At your rustic temple I prayed
              <br>
              With a little boy's simple faith
              <br>
              And your aura's flawless breath
              <br>
              Filled my heart with joy profound.
              <br>
              Saw I God in the grandeur
              <br>
              Of your woods which for centuries stand;
              <br>
              Never did I understand
              <br>
              In your bosom what sorrows were;
              <br>
              While I gazed on your azure sky
              <br>
              Neither love nor tenderness
              <br>
              Failed me, 'cause my happiness
              <br>
              In the heart of nature rests there.

              Return thee to my heart,
