          Whereas, today, more than other period of our history, there is a need for a re-dedication to the ideals of freedom
          and nationalism for which our heroes lived and died.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas, it is meet that in honoring them, particularly the national hero and patriot, Jose Rizal,
          we remember with special fondness and devotion their lives and works that have shaped the national character;
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas, the life, works and writings of Jose Rizal particularly his novels
          Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, are a constant and inspiring source of patriotism with which the minds of the youth,
          especially during their formative and decisive years in school, should be suffused.

          Whereas, all educational institutions are under the supervision of, and subject to regulation by the State,

          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled.
