              <p class="card-text lead">Consuelo Ortiga y Rey, the prettier of Don Pablo Ortiga’s daughters, fell in love with him.
                He dedicated to her A la Senorita C.O. y R., which became one of his best poems. The Ortiga's residence in Madrid was
                frequented by Rizal and his compatriots. He probably fell in love with her and Consuelo apparently asked him for romantic
                verses. He suddenly backed out before the relationship turned into a serious romance, because he wanted to remain loyal to
                Leonor Rivera and he did not want to destroy his friendship with Eduardo de Lete who was madly in love with Consuelo.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title sub-heading">Nellie Boustead</h5>
              <p class="card-text lead">Rizal having lost Leonor Rivera, entertained the thought of courting other ladies. While a guest of
                the Boustead family at their residence in the resort city of Biarritz, he had befriended the two pretty daughters of his host,
                Eduardo Boustead. Rizal used to fence with the sisters at the studio of Juan Luna. Antonio Luna, Juan’s brother and also a
                frequent visitor of the Bousteads, courted Nellie but she was deeply infatuated with Rizal. In a party held by Filipinos in
                Madrid, a drunken Antonio Luna uttered unsavory remarks against Nellie Boustead. This prompted Rizal to challenge Luna into
                a duel. Fortunately, Luna apologized to Rizal, thus averting tragedy for the compatriots. <br> <br>

                Their love affair unfortunately did not end in marriage. It failed because Rizal refused to be converted to the
                Protestant faith, as Nellie demanded and Nellie’s mother did not like a physician without enough paying clientele to be a
                son-in-law. The lovers, however, parted as good friends when Rizal left Europe.

                She also helped Rizal improve his knowledge of Japanese language. If Rizal was a man without a patriotic mission, he would have
                married this lovely and intelligent woman and lived a stable and happy life with her in Japan because Spanish legation there offered
                him a lucrative job.</p>

                Leonor believing that Rizal had already forgotten her, sadly consented her to marry the Englishman Henry Kipping,

                Paris to avoid Gertrude, who was seriously in love with him. Before leaving London, he was able to finish the group carving of the
                Beckett sisters. He gave the group carving to Gertrude as a sign of their brief relationship.</p>

                from Hong Kong, who came to Dapitan to seek Rizal for eye treatment. Rizal was physically attracted to her. His loneliness
                and boredom must have taken the measure of him and what could be a better diversion that to fall in love again. But the Rizal
                sisters suspected Josephine as an agent of the friars and they considered her as a threat to Rizal’s security.</p>
