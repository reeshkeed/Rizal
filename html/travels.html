        Rizal sent to Dr. Carlos Czepelack his sculptural work Revancha in exchange for the
        beautiful landscape he received from the latter. During the previous days he read the book
        of Multatuli, a Dutch author. He found the book similar to his Noli with difference, however,
        on the strength of attack. Rizal’s attacks are more violent than those of Multatuli’s.
