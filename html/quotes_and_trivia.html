            Did you know Rizal’s mother could have been an illegitimate child. In 1814, Rizal’s grandfather Lorenzo Alberto Alonso, then 24, married 12-year-old Ilocana Paula Florentino. However, Ocampo wrote that years later, the same Lorenzo Alberto Alonso was spotted in Biñan with Brigida Quintos. They bore five children, one of which was Teodora Alonso, Rizal’s mother. Strangely enough, documents in Santa Cruz Church, Manila, are complete right down to the 18th century—except the volume that held Teodora Alonso’s baptismal records. Rizal, being the only member of his family to use this surname instead of "Mercado," also thought he was an illegitimate child. However, his family insisted on using "Rizal" to avoid association with brother Paciano Mercado, who was involved in the Gomburza issue of 1872.
