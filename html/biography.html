        Childhood of Rizal
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p class="lead">
        ⦁	Rizal's childhood was the happiest period of his life. <br>
        ⦁	Calamba, the hero's hometown, belonged to the Dominican Order. <br>
        ⦁	A few kilometers south of Calamba lies mount Makiling. <br>
        ⦁	East of the town is Laguna de Bay. <br>
        ⦁	Rizal was a student in the Ateneo de Manila in 1876 when he was 15 years old. <br>
        ⦁	When he was fifteen, he wrote the poem entitled In Memory of My Town (Un Recuerdo A Mi Pueblo) <br>
        ⦁	Rizal was sickly, underweight, undersized, and frail as a child. <br>
        ⦁	He had his own nipa cottage where he played in the day, built by his father. <br>
        ⦁	He had an aya (nurse maid) who has a kind old woman and who took care of him and his health. <br>
        ⦁	He began birdwatching at the age of 3, observing the culiauan, the maya, the maria capra, the martin, and the pipit. <br>
        ⦁	He recited the Angelus prayer daily. <br>
        ⦁	Of all his sisters, Jose loved little Concepcion best.  She was only a year younger than him, and fell ill and died at the age of 3. <br>
        ⦁	The death of his sister was Jose's first grief. <br>
        ⦁	Jose and his father went on a pilgrimage to Antipolo on June 6, 1868 so that they could fulfill his mother's vow, which she made when Jose was born.  Teodora could not join them on this pilgrimage because she had given birth to Jose's sister Trinidad. <br>
        ⦁	After the pilgrimage, Jose went with his father to Manila where they visited his sister Saturnina, who was then a boarding student at La Concordia College in Santa Ana. <br>
        ⦁	On "The Story of the Moth," Rizal thought that the creature's death was justified because he believed that to sacrifice one's life for one's ideals is worthwhile. <br>
        ⦁	He began sketching at the age of five. <br>
        ⦁	He had a black dog named Usman. <br>
        ⦁	At the age of eight, Jose wrote his first poem entitled Sa Aking Mga Kababata (To My Fellow Children). <br>
        ⦁	When he was also eight years old, Rizal write his first dramatic work, which was a Tagalog comedy.  It was staged in a festival in Calamba, and was later sold to a gobernadorcillo from Paete for two pesos. <br>
        ⦁	Jose was skilled in operating marionettes. <br>
        ⦁	He used to meditate by Laguna de Bay with his pet dog, Usman. <br>

      <p class="lead">
        When he was four years old, his sister Conception, the eight child in the Rizal family,

        for five months until his (Monroy) death, taught Rizal the rudiments of Latin.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        At about this time two of his mother’s cousin frequented Calamba. Uncle Manuel Alberto, seeing Rizal frail in body,
        concerned himself with the physical development of his young nephew and taught the latter love for the open air and
        developed in him a great admiration for the beauty of nature, while Uncle Gregorio, a scholar, instilled into the mind of the boy
        love for education. He advised Rizal: "Work hard and perform every task very carefully; learn to be swift as well as thorough;
        be independent in thinking and make visual pictures of everything."

        Family of Rizal

        The Mercado - Rizal Family 
      </h5>
      <br>
      <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
        The Rizals is considered one of the biggest families during their time. Domingo Lam-co, the family's paternal ascendant
        was a full-blooded Chinese who came to the Philippines from Amoy, China in the closing years of the 17th century and
        married a Chinese half-breed by the name of Ines de la Rosa. <br> <br>

        Researchers revealed that the Mercado-Rizal family had also traces of Japanese, Spanish, Malay and Even
        Negrito blood aside from Chinese. <br> <br>

        Jose Rizal came from a 13-member family consisting of his parents, Francisco Mercado II and Teodora Alonso Realonda,
        and nine sisters and one brother.
